                                    Our software package, AlgoSwitch, is able to utilize data and synergies between these three steps to increase a miner’s income
                                    by 15% by utilizing pre-existing algorithm switching technology as well as by reducing
                                    fees by 3-5%.

                                We understand the risk of investing in cryptocurrencies which is why we liquidate frequently and pay out monthly dividends
                                to customers and shareholders. We believe the future of mining is more reliable than investing
                                directly in cryptocurrency. Decentralized applications cannot run without large amounts of
                                computing power. Additionally, a market-wide switch to proof-of-stake (PoS) is unlikely because
                                many decentralized networks depend on the computing power from miners. We mitigate any risks
                                by participating in not only mining, but establishing nodes, and developing mining applications
                                and tools that we can use internally and eventually monetize for use by other miners.

                                <br> It is hard to dispute that blockchain is a revolutionary technology. However, it is not
                                as efficient as many believe. Blockchain is limited to very specific applications and has
                                a bottleneck in computing efficiency; grid-computing (what the blockchain uses) is hundreds,
                                and even thousands of times more computationally intensive than localized systems. We believe
                                this technology has tremendous potential, but has a lot of room to improve.

                                Cryptocurrencies are a form of digital currency, created and held electronically. Coins aren’t printed like dollars or euros,
                                they’re produced by people and businesses running computers all around the world using software
                                that solves mathematical problems.
                                <br>
                                <br> Imagine that someone has a dollar. When you give that dollar to someone else you can prove
                                that the dollar was transferred. But, if somebody sends you a digital file, how can you prove
                                that the sender didn’t save a copy of it? It would be the equivalent of being able to print
                                dollars out of thin air. Cryptocurrencies solve this problem by using complex computer software.
                                Miners, like a notary, verify who owns each cryptocurrency coin. No government or individual
                                controls it, nor are the coins printed like paper money. These same miners are rewarded with
                                payouts of cryptocurrency for ensuring the security and reliability of the network. Anyone
                                can become a miner. However, the computer software necessary to run this system has become
                                so complex that only specialized computers can mine profitably.

                                Mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger, known as the block chain, and also
                                the means through which new coins are released. Anyone with access to the internet and suitable
                                hardware can participate in mining.
                                <br>
                                <br>Miners use their hardware in a process that involves compiling recent transactions into blocks
                                and trying to solve a computationally difficult puzzle. The participant who first solves
                                the puzzle gets to place the next group, or block, of transactions on the blockchain and
                                claim the rewards.
                                <br>
                                <br>These rewards, which incentivize mining, are both the transaction fees associated with the
                                transactions compiled in the block as well as newly released cryptocurrency. Block rewards
                                can be thought of as “minting” new cryptocurrency, whereas transaction fees use existing
                                cryptocurrency.

                                Coinglomerate chooses to use graphics processing units (GPUs) over more specialized Application-Specific Integrated Circuit
                                Chips (ASICs). Although ASICs are more powerful, they are currently limited to only mining
                                Bitcoin and offer very little resale value after they become obsolete. Bitcoin mining is
                                also much more competitive than GPU mining. Simply put, GPU mining is more profitable and
                                less risky.
                                <br>
                                <br> For example, If profits decrease and a pivot in operations is necessary, ASIC computers
                                would not provide us resale value or a simple application in other industries. With GPUs,
                                we not only hold plenty of power, but a computer with a high salvage value that could also
                                be transferred to other tasks if necessary such as establishing nodes or grid/cloud computing.
                                This allows our company to have a lot more flexibility and hedge against any possible downturn
                                in the market even if only temporary.

                                <br>Coinglomerate uses a mixture of newly released Nvidia and AMD graphics cards. We use a mix
                                because buying large quantities of a single card is oftentimes less cost effective. We always
                                try to maximize the amount of computing power we get per dollar. We test each new series
                                so we can fill our facilities with the most up to date technology that passes our highest
                                benchmark ratings.

                                Mining cryptocurrency is not the only source of potential revenue our facilities can produce. If something happens to the
                                market, we have identified the following sources of revenue to be feasible with our projected
                                GPU setup:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Software sensor:</strong> Rent out a distributed set of real IP addresses to monitor
                                        website uptime and latency. We previously published this example as ping21.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Hardware sensor:</strong> Rent out a geographically distributed set of measurement
                                        devices to record sensor data on the environment. An example is sensor21, which we
                                        cover below.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Software actuator:</strong> Rent a distributed set of real IP addresses to benchmark
                                        your website’s performance. You’d require email validation to confirm domain ownership
                                        to prevent DDOS.
                                    </li>

                                        <strong>Hardware actuator:</strong> Rent drones owned by different operators to mass in a
                                        specified location. This is a fun one for movie shoots, drone races, or simply cryptocurrency-powered
                                        supervillainry. You’d pay a ground station running something like dronekit-python.</li>

                                        <strong>Sensor21:</strong> Get paid in Bitcoin for collecting environmental data.</li>

                                <strong>Payment freedom -</strong> It is possible to send and receive cryptocurrencies anywhere in
                                the world at any time. No bank holidays. No borders. No bureaucracy. Cryptocurrency users
                                are in full control of their money.

                                <strong>Choose your own fees -</strong> There is no fee to receive cryptocurrencies, and most wallets
                                allow you to control how much you pay in transaction fees. Higher transaction fees encourage
                                faster confirmation of your transactions. Fees are not dependent on the amount transferred,
                                so it costs the same amount to send 1000 Bitcoin as it does to send 1 Bitcoin.

                                <strong>Fewer risks for merchants -</strong> Cryptocurrency transactions are secure, irreversible,
                                and anonymous. This protects merchants from fraud and fraudulent chargebacks, and protects
                                the identity of the customer.

                                <strong>Security and control -</strong> Cryptocurrency users get full control over their transactions.
                                It’s impossible for merchants to charge recurring fees without your explicit permission.

                                are readily available on the blockchain’s public ledger; anybody can use and verify this
                                information in real-time. No individual or organization can control or manipulate how a cryptocurrency
                                operates because of its inherent software protocol.

                                works. Every transaction and coin ever issued can be cross-referenced by anyone.

                                <br> What makes cryptocurrencies even more remarkable is that it doesn’t require trust. Traditionally,
                                people would need to trust banks or government institutions to protect and insure their funds.
                                Instead, cryptocurrencies use a heavily peer-reviewed software algorithm which no organization
                                or individual can control, and doesn’t require its users to trust any individual or organization.
